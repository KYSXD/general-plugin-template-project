# How to contribute


This project gladly accepts pull requests. Keep your PRs as short and simple as possible
with accompanying tests if possible. The better described your Pull Request is, the faster
it will be accepted.

In order to keep the project active, anyone that gets a significant PR accepted will be given write
access to the repo. Significant PR's include non-trivial bug fixes, new features, etc. Fixing
the spelling in a file is not a significant change.

# Submitting Issues

Issues for feature requests, bugs, questions, thoughts, etc are welcome. Pull requests should always
reference an issue when possible. If you find a bug and have a fix for it, create an issue and THEN
submit the Pull Request and reference it.
